# 2D-Platformer-Template

## Intro

2D Platformer made with Raylib in C++
This project goal is to create a template to start a game, understand how the lib works and create tools like Makefile to quickly compile it and make it work.

The game is one of the example of raylib that has been almost fully rewritten in C++ using classes.
